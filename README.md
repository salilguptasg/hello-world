Time to brush up the development skills again ;-)

I am a seasonal DBA who started his career as a Developer/DBA around the databases. During the last 12+ years - i have worked on languages: Java, C++, VC++, .NET; Scripting - bash, bat, vbs, PoSH; SQL - TSQL, PL/SQL; Databases - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc; and it seems its time to go back to the place from where it all started - Put on the development shoes around the cloud technologies ;-)
